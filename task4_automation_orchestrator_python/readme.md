#  Task 4: Automation Orchestrator â€“ AI Merch Maker Lite

This module automates the AI Merch Maker pipeline by:
1. Generating a fun T-shirt product using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model.
2. Sending the product to a local fake publisher API for publishing.

Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, this orchestrator can be run manually and simulates the daily product generation and publishing workflow.
